        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is one of Rome's four classic pastas
             (cacio e pepe, amatricana, and gricia being the others). What distinguishes
            carbonara from other pasta dishes is its technique of combining eggs,
        hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper into a rich, silky sauce.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb Spaghetti (or any long noodle)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 pound bacon or pancetta</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Heat the pasta water:</strong> Put a large pot of salted water
            on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.)</li>
            <li><strong>Saute the bacon (or pancetta) and garlic:</strong> While the water
            is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large saute pan over
            medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy. Then
            add the garlic and cook another minute, turn off the heat and put the
            bacon and garlic into a large bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Beat the eggs and half of the cheese:</strong> In a small bowl,
            beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the pasta:</strong> Once the water has reached a rolling boil,
            add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.</li>
            <li><strong>Toss the pasta with bacon (or pancetta):</strong> When the pasta
            is al dente, use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let
            it be dripping wet. reserve some of the pasta water. Move the pasta from
            the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. it's the heat of
            the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to creat a creamy sauce. Toss
            everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it
            doesn't make the eggs curdle.</li>
        </ol>
